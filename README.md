# allergy-alert

## Idea and Goals:
Allergy Alert is a web application designed to help users identify the percentage chance that a particular allergen or set of allergens are in a particular food.

## Repository Layout:


reports: Contains the teams weekly status reports  
src: Houses the source code  
&emsp;&emsp;backend: Contains backend code for the server and database  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;api: Contains functions for different API calls that might be made by a client


We are planning on adding a subdirectory to src for frontend code as well as a top level directory containing our tests.
