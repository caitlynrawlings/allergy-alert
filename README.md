# Allergy Alert
**Version ID:** v1.0.1  

**Idea and Goals:** Allergy Alert is a web application designed to help users identify the percentage chance that a particular allergen or set of allergens are in a particular food. This percentage should be based on as many recipes as possible, and we plan on using as many as 2 million recipes in order to produce accurate results for different queries.

## User Manual

### High Level Description of Features and Functionality
Allergy Alert allows users to search for a food item to see how common certain ingredients are in recipes for that item to determine the likelihood that certain ingredients are in a food item. The app will display information for recipes that match the users search and the percentage of those recipes that contain different ingredients. Users can also input there allergies to the website and on search of a food item, the website will display an alert if one of their allergens is contained in recipes for that food item.

### How to Access and Run the Software
1. Open your favorite web browser
2. Navigate to: https://allergyalert.onrender.com/
3. Explore Allergy Alert

### How to Use the Software
Simply type allergies into the allergies bar, press enter to submit. To delete an allergy click the "X" next to the allergy under the allergy list section. Type the recipe you want to search for into the recipe serach bar and hit enter to submit. If recipies from our database match the search then those recipes will appear, along with the ingredients in the recipe and the percent of the recipes for that item in our database that use that ingredient.

### How to Report a Bug
Submit a bug using the "Issues" section on our project's Github: https://github.com/wdrbork/allergy-alert
Guidelines for bug reports:
1. Use the GitHub issue search â€” check if the issue has already been reported.
2. Create a new issue.
3. Explain the steps you took to get to the place where the bug occured when reporting.
Refer to this document for additional information on bug reporting practices: https://github.com/brycelelbach/cpp_bug_reporting_guidelines

### Known Bugs
1. If certain ingredients have allergies, the website will not display those allergies since they are deeper down
than our priorities for the project thus far.

### How to Install the Software
1. Ensure that you have the latest version of Git installed
    - Run `git version` on your device's terminal
    - If an error occurs, go [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to download the latest version of Git
2. Download the repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/wdrbork/allergy-alert.git`
3. Ensure that you have version v20.9.0 of Node.js or later installed
    - Run `node -v` on your device's terminal
    - If an error occurs, go [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to download the latest version of Node.js
4. Install backend dependencies by navigating to the "server" directory and running `npm install`
5. Install frontend dependencies by navigating to the "client" directory and running `npm install`  

### How to Build the Software
After installing the software, use one terminal to run `npm start` under the "server" directory and another terminal to run `npm start` under the "client" directory. This will start up the servers for both the frontend and the backend.
    - If you receive an error saying that nodemon cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on your system, you will need to change your system's execution policy
    - To do this on Windows, run Powershell as an administrator, and call the command `Get-ExecutionPolicy`. It should be "Restricted." Then, call `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`. This will allow you to run nodemon.
    - If you ever want to go back on this change, simply call the command `Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope CurrentUser`
    - For more information on execution policies, see [the Microsoft docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.3)  

### How to Test the Software
After installing the software, to run tests for the backend, navigate to the "server" directory and run `npm test`. To run tests for the frontend, navigate to the "client" directory and run `npm test`. 

### How to add new tests
Use descriptive test names and group similar tests under a describe() function.  

- For server tests: Add tests to server/scr/test folder.  
Use this link as a reference for writing mocha tests: https://www.browserstack.com/guide/unit-testing-for-nodejs-using-mocha-and-chai
