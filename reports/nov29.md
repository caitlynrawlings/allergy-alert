### Caitlyn Rawlings
#### Last Week's Goals:
- Finish the cookie implemnetation
- add tests for frontend

#### Progress and Issues:
What I did: I finished adding the reading/writing user cookies to cache user allergies.
I helped brainstorm ui ideas.

What worked: Using postman to test the api routes was very helpful. I was making a new 
value for the cookie value, which is supposed to be a unique thing, but I changed to using 
the document id that mongodb automatically generates, becasue they are already unique.

What I learned: I learned about about writing routes. And about what the some of mongodbs 
provided methods

Where I had trouble: I had trouble trying to get the routes to work. I had trouble with the 
find method, because I was trying to make my own unique value for the cookies.

Where I was blocked: I was blocked when I was trying to trying to create my own 
unique values for the cookies.

#### Plans for next week: 
- add tests for frontend
- Look into vercel
