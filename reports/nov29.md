# Status Report: November 29
## Team Report
#### Last Week's Goals:
- Finalize web interface
- Add disclaimer/warning about validity of information
- Implement feedback from peers
- Implement storing allergies for each user (caching)
- Add tests

#### Progress and Issues:
What we did: We added test. Brainstormed what we want our ui to look like.
Added cookies to cache user allergies.

What worked: Communication about what we want for UI and building off of each
others ideas.

What we learned: We learned about ui design principles. Things about changing color
and fonts and utilizing space to create visual hierarcy.

Where we had trouble: We are having trouble narrowing down what ui design we want.

Where we are blocked: Blocked on deploying our app to a publicly accessible domain.

#### Plans for next week:
- Add to tests
- Add disclaimer/warning about validity of information
- Implement feedback from peers
- Work on deploying our app to a publically accessable domain
- Work on UI design


The next deadline to work toward will be: Finalizing our product by the final 
release deadline of December 5

### Caitlyn Rawlings
#### Last Week's Goals:
- Finish the cookie implemnetation
- add tests for frontend

#### Progress and Issues:
What I did: I finished adding the reading/writing user cookies to cache user allergies.
I helped brainstorm ui ideas.

What worked: Using postman to test the api routes was very helpful. I was making a new 
value for the cookie value, which is supposed to be a unique thing, but I changed to using 
the document id that mongodb automatically generates, becasue they are already unique.

What I learned: I learned about about writing routes. And about what the some of mongodbs 
provided methods

Where I had trouble: I had trouble trying to get the routes to work. I had trouble with the 
find method, because I was trying to make my own unique value for the cookies.

Where I was blocked: I was blocked when I was trying to trying to create my own 
unique values for the cookies.

#### Plans for next week: 
- add tests for frontend
- Look into vercel

### Aakanksh Yadav
#### Last Week's Goals:
- Run through many more UI design ideas to decide upon one with the rest of the group
- Work on structuring the frontend properly as per the UI design specifics
- Potentially host front and back ends on Render (or Vercel... more research necessary) but only when the group is ready

#### Progress and Issues:
What I did: I drew up 2 potential layouts for the UI design of our finished website (taking into consideration all of the different possible components and features we discussed as a group); I shared these with the team to get feedback and sometimes see them refine my design from their perspectives so we could come to consensus.

What worked: Sitting together in person as we talked through all of this; we originally thought of voting to pick between different designs through messaging but this was not as successful as organic conversation in a physical workspace.

What I learned: There were many components of the UI and UX design that I had not even thought about that my group mates suggested (like what aesthetic flairs may be nice and what ones would be too noisy; how I could cater the design of the allergy list more to the users' needs depending on frequency of use; etc.) I also learned of the difficulties involved with choosing only one UI design when there are so many different ones that are all good in their own ways (and how to combine them, in some sense).

Where I had trouble: It was hard to go back and forth with the group organically for our UI design ideas due to the break taking away one of our usual meeting times.

Where I was blocked: For a bit, I was blocked since we had to finalize our decision on one UI design before moving forward to implementation. This is no longer a problem as we finally decided on one just recently and the rest should be smooth sailing.

#### Plans for next week:
- Finish and finalize the frontend
- Help with CSS to implement our UI design concept into our final website
- Help refine the search system if we have the time and any ideas for that
- Help the backend developers finish updating our dataset to the full-sized one if needed
- Finish final milestone!
