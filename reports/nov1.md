# Status Report: November 1
## Team Report
#### Last Week's Goals:
- Create REST API
- Git, Testing and CI milestone
- Implement search logic for finding recipes
- Implement percentage calculation feature
- Develop README doc more

#### Progress and Issues:
What we did: 

What worked: 

What we learned: We learned a good strategy for determining what tools we could utilize and if they would work well together is to see if they have been paired together previously. Melanie (our TA) recemended that we check on youtube as well as looking for other resources to see if there is a lot of information on how to deal with issues with the pairing to determine if it is a commonly used set of tools.

## Individual Contributions
### Riley Bork
#### Last Week's Goals:
-Get a full understanding of how we want to store the data as well as search through it via complex searches
-Learn more about the MERN technology stack as we might be using it going forward
-Prepare the database for the inclusion of recipes by establishing attributes for each entry (if we continue with the database idea)

### Aakanksh Yadav
#### Last Week’s Goals:
- Finalize the data format to use to have our front and back end communicate (with the people that will be working on the back end)
- Look into ReactJS and any other frontend options so that I can decide on which to use and learn any skills I may need for this project
- Help backend developers with any work they may need to do for setting up the MongoDB database, etc.
#### Progress and Issues:
What I did: I worked with the team members in charge of our backend to finalize what format we are going to use to store our data in our backend; I worked to understand better how REST APIs work and how I could work around the unknown and undecided aspects of our project to get a headstart on the frontend; I looked into how ExpressJS works and researched how we may want to set up our project directory to connect the front and back ends; I researched to find which hosting service we could use to host our front and back ends (and found some tutorials for those so that everyone could be on the same page regarding how those worked).
What worked: As always, working while consistently being in contact with the other team members, bouncing ideas off of each other both so that everyone can be on the same page and so that we can incorporate many perspectives into making decisions. I think doing proper and extensive research on technologies before making any big architectural decisions helped a lot because, unlike during the first few weeks, now we have a better understanding of where we want to go with the project and we have to consider the scope and complexity of each decision way more carefully.
What I learned: I learned more about how data can be stored into MongoDB; I got a better understanding of how ExpressJS will connect the front and back ends (and what role REST APIs will play in that); I learned a lot about many different hosting services for our front and back ends (and how those are hosted in the first place) as well as what might be our best choice for this project; I learned about GitHub Actions and why CI/CD systems will be helpful as we work on this project.
Where I had trouble: I was having a lot of trouble with finding a good hosting service that was also inexpensive; this was also the reason why I was not able to focus my time on setting up the CI/CD systems with the other team members. I hope to be able to catch up on that in the coming week.
Where I am blocked: everything is fine for now
#### Plans for next week:
- Talk through our CI/CD system with my group so I am fully up to speed with it
- Help implement the search feature for our beta release (backend + search only)
- Fully adapt/finish setting up our directory to be hosted on Render (important)
- Talk to the team member in charge of UI design to coordinate how he could start on UI design for my frontend (and how we could effectively communicate to maximize how concurrent that process is)
- Start implementing frontend as soon as possible (when server hosting is done)
