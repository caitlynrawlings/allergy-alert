# Status Report: November 1
## Team Report
#### Last Week's Goals:
- Create REST API
- Git, Testing and CI milestone
- Implement search logic for finding recipes
- Implement percentage calculation feature
- Develop README doc more

#### Progress and Issues:
What we did: 

What worked: 

What we learned: We learned a good strategy for determining what tools we could utilize and if they would work well together is to see if they have been paired together previously. Melanie (our TA) recemended that we check on youtube as well as looking for other resources to see if there is a lot of information on how to deal with issues with the pairing to determine if it is a commonly used set of tools.

## Individual Contributions
### Riley Bork
#### Last Week's Goals:
-Get a full understanding of how we want to store the data as well as search through it via complex searches
-Learn more about the MERN technology stack as we might be using it going forward
-Prepare the database for the inclusion of recipes by establishing attributes for each entry (if we continue with the database idea)

#### Progress and Issues:
What I did: I learned exactly how we plan on storing the data in the database. 
I also made progress when it comes to learning about the MERN stack, and I was 
able to implement a system in which the frontend can make a call to a backend 
API that returns a JSON object containing all the recipes in the database as 
well as specific recipes if a query is included.

What worked: Communication with my team regarding our methods for storing 
recipes as well as additional research regarding the MERN stack helped me make
progress on the implementation of the database and our REST API.

What I learned: I learned more about REST API and how we might use it to get 
certain items from our database.

Where I had trouble: I didn't really have much trouble with anything this week.
I might be a little behind schedule but I'm sure I can catch up before the beta
is released.

Where I was blocked: Getting COVID wasn't ideal, especially since it made me 
miss last Thursday's meeting, but I am fully recovered now.

#### Plans for next week: 
- Add our CSV file of 500,000 recipes to the database
- Fully implement the REST API in preparation for the beta release

### Phillip Phan
#### Last Week's Goals:
- I plan to learn more about MongoDB
- Look at the datasets and plan a structure for the database

### Aakanksh Yadav
#### Last Week's Goals:
- Research ReactJS more and how I may be able to use it to implement some of the more complex components of our project
- Research ExpressJS more in detail so that I can maybe start working around it as I construct the frontend (while the backend is being finished)
- Start designing a search algorithm as soon as the data format for the backend is decided upon
- Help with making a mock version of the website
