What worked: 

What we learned: We learned a good strategy for determining what tools we could utilize and if they would work well together is to see if they have been paired together previously. Melanie (our TA) recemended that we check on youtube as well as looking for other resources to see if there is a lot of information on how to deal with issues with the pairing to determine if it is a commonly used set of tools.
