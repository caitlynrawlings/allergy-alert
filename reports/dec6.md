# Status Report: December 6
## Team Report
#### Last Week's Goals:
- Add to tests
- Add disclaimer/warning about validity of information
- Implement feedback from peers
- Work on deploying our app to a publically accessable domain
- Work on UI design

#### Progress and Issues:
What we did: We deployed the app. We added search options. We worked on the design of the app. Added to/fixed documentation. We added more recipes to database.

What worked: Deploying the app on render worked. We also used env variables to help us still work on localhost while developing.

What we learned: We learned about using env variables to help us develop on local host, while still having the app deployed on render.

Where we had trouble: We had some trouble because we added too many recipes to the data base and search was very slow, so we reduced the amount. 

Where we are blocked: Not blocked. We're done!

### Jack Rosenbloom
#### Last Week's Goals:
- Attempt to get animations to work. If FramerMotion works well on one or two aspects of the UI, I might try to add if to many others given I have the time and other team members mutually agree on the changes.
