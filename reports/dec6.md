# Status Report: December 6
## Team Report
#### Last Week's Goals:
- Add to tests
- Add disclaimer/warning about validity of information
- Implement feedback from peers
- Work on deploying our app to a publically accessable domain
- Work on UI design

#### Progress and Issues:
What we did: We deployed the app. We added search options. We worked on the design of the app. Added to/fixed documentation. We added more recipes to database.

What worked: Deploying the app on render worked. We also used env variables to help us still work on localhost while developing.

What we learned: We learned about using env variables to help us develop on local host, while still having the app deployed on render.

Where we had trouble: We had some trouble because we added too many recipes to the data base and search was very slow, so we reduced the amount. 

Where we are blocked: Not blocked. We're done!

### Phillip Phan
#### Last Week's Goals:
- Implement any final features that the group wants

#### Progress and Issues:
What I did: I removed highlighter since it was behaving weird and redid it so the ingredient in the recipe that are an allergy
instead show up first in the list. I also worked on expanding the database to have more data but decided to revert that as there was to much
data.

What worked: Having the ingredients that are allergy pop up first on the list

What I learned: I learned about how slow our website would get with a very large dataset

Where I had trouble: Tried making it so our database had half a million recipes but that really slowed down our website search so
we revert back to a smaller amount of recipes

Where I was blocked: I was blocked by my other final group project which is due at similar times to this project.


### Caitlyn Rawlings

- add tests for frontend
- Look into vercel

#### Progress and Issues:
What I did: I added options for user search. So they could filter results and also choose number of results to display.

What worked: Using dropdown menus for these options.

What I learned: I learned about code refactoring and html select elements.

Where I had trouble: I didn't have trouble.

Where I was blocked: Not blocked. We're done!


### Jack Rosenbloom
#### Last Week's Goals:
- Attempt to get animations to work. If FramerMotion works well on one or two aspects of the UI, I might try to add if to many others given I have the time and other team members mutually agree on the changes.
