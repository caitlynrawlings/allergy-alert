# Status Report: October 25
## Team Report
#### Last Week's Goals:
- Find websites or datasets that we could incorporate into our database
- Construct the database
- Discuss and determine what format we will store our data in
- Start scraping those websites or reading those datasets
- Decide on what front end technologies/frameworks we will use
- Complete architecture and design milestone

#### Progress and Issues:
What we did: Completed architecture and design milestone. Found a dataset of recipes and set up a database. Completed UI mockup.

What worked: Team communication worked well through discord. Setting up schedule to layout our tasks so we have a better idea of the project timeline and what will be feasible.

What we learned: Learned about how MongoDB will interface with expressJS. 

Where we had trouble: We encountered difficulties in understanding how MongoDB will interface with ExpressJS. While progress was made, there were still uncertainties about the integration of these technologies. This lack of clarity led to some delays in setting up our database and developing the backend.

Where we are blocked: There are knowledge gaps in specific areas of the tools that we are using. These gaps have resulted from varying levels of familiarity with the technologies we are planning on utilizing.

#### Plans for next week:
- Create REST API
- Git, Testing and CI milestone
- Implement search logic for finding recipes
- Implement percentage calculation feature
- Develop README doc more

The next deadline to work toward will be: implement search logic by 11/4

## Individual Contributions
### Riley Bork
#### Last Week's Goals:
- Learn more about MongoDB and how we might want to implement it
- Make a very tiny full stack project so that I can get a better understanding of combining the front-end with the back-end

#### Progress and Issues:
What I did: I established the database on MongoDB and implemented it into our repository. I included two “collections” (basically sub-databases): one for user accounts, and the other for all the recipes we will be storing. While implementing it, I also added documentation to the load_db.py file that includes how to use important database functions such as find(), insert_one(), and delete_one(). I also watched several YouTube videos that covered the basics of using MongoDB and a REST API, two things that we are still not sure if we are going to use.

What worked: Doing additional research on how MongoDB and REST APIs work gave me more confidence when it came to using those tools to create a functioning front-end and back-end connection. More research still needs to be done, but I feel like I have a basic understanding of those tools at the moment.

What I learned: I learned about the various MongoDB functions that we could use to insert and remove entries in the database. I also learned how to use HTTP requests to get information from the database as well as send that information back using HTTP responses.

Where I had trouble: I had some trouble catching up with new ideas that the group came up with since I could not attend last Thursday’s meeting. This has resulted in me falling behind the others in my group, although I hope to get a full understanding of our plan over the next few days through team communication and reading everybody else’s individual status reports.

Where I was blocked: I had an interview this past Thursday that prevented me from going to the meeting, so I feel a little behind when it comes to how we will be implementing the database. I also tested positive for COVID this Tuesday, so I will not be able to attend the meeting this Thursday either.

#### Plans for next week: 
-Get a full understanding of how we want to store the data as well as search through it via complex searches
-Learn more about the MERN technology stack as we might be using it going forward
-Prepare the database for the inclusion of recipes by establishing attributes for each entry (if we continue with the database idea)

### Phillip Phan

### Caitlyn Rawlings
#### Last Week's Goals:
- Make and share doc for architecture and design milestone
- Figure out what we are doing for frontend and review some react/JS

#### Progress and Issues:
What I did: Made frontend mockup. Worked on schedule/testing/documentation parts for architecture and design milestone.

What worked: Using template on figma instead of starting for stratch for design. Using requirements and group members ideas to determine what we need in the ui to deliver the functionality we want.

What I learned: How to use figma. Learned what we are using for recipe data + how we are planning on setting up architecture and design. 

Where I had trouble: Writing out schedule because it is difficult to estimate how long tasks will take and to determine what tasks will need to be completed to the specificity that was being asked for in the instructions.

Where I am blocked: Need to learn some expressJS so I can help with frontend

#### Plans for next week:
- work on incorporating ExpressJS calls into frontend functionality
- Work on developing README doc

### Jack Rosenbloom
#### Last Week’s Goals:
Last time my goal was to learn and become more familiar with css and make a mock website for our project.

#### Progress and Issues:
What I did: Began learning CSS, made a sample website with basic server connection through js. Also came up with ideas for the structure, design, and implementation of the website.

What worked: I found that video tutorials, forums, and online resources were a great place to start adventuring into css and learn the basics. I also got into HTML because of this since HTML and CSS go hand in hand quite a bit during web development.

What I learned: I learned general structure and design elements in CSS, how to begin scaling projects, as well as some basic design principles in CSS.

Where I had trouble: I didn’t have a ton of trouble since the hard part doesn’t come much until later when I have to connect the front end to the CSS for the website and configure all the fun stuff. Most of my work this week consisted of figuring out fundamentals, not diving into the upper echelons of css development.

Where I am blocked: Not blocked yet. Just doing what I can and keeping up to date with the team.

#### Plans for next week:
- Polish mock website and create more design structure ideas.
- Connect with team members to discuss further design choices.

### Aakanksh Yadav
#### Last Week's Goals:
- Finalize the data format to use to have our front and back end communicate (with the people that will be working on the back end)
- Look into ReactJS and any other frontend options so that I can decide on which to use and learn any skills I may need for this project
- Help backend developers with any work they may need to do for setting up the MongoDB database, etc.
