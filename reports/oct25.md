# Status Report: October 25
## Team Report
#### Last Week's Goals:
- Find websites or datasets that we could incorporate into our database
- Construct the database
- Discuss and determine what format we will store our data in
- Start scraping those websites or reading those datasets
- Decide on what front end technologies/frameworks we will use
- Complete architecture and design milestone

#### Progress and Issues:
What we did: Completed architecture and design milestone. Found a dataset of recipes and set up a database. Completed UI mockup.

What worked: Team communication worked well through discord. Setting up schedule to layout our tasks so we have a better idea of the project timeline and what will be feasible.

What we learned: Learned about how MongoDB will interface with expressJS

Where we had trouble: 

Where we are blocked: 

#### Plans for next week:
- Create REST API
- Git, Testing and CI milestone
- Implement search logic for finding recipes
- Implement percentage calculation feature
- Develop README doc more

The next deadline to work toward will be: implement search logic by 11/4

## Individual Contributions
### Riley Bork
#### Last Week's Goals:
- Learn more about MongoDB and how we might want to implement it
- Make a very tiny full stack project so that I can get a better understanding of combining the front-end with the back-end

### Caitlyn Rawlings
#### Last Week's Goals:
- Make and share doc for architecture and design milestone
- Figure out what we are doing for frontend and review some react/JS

#### Progress and Issues:
What I did: Made frontend mockup. Worked on schedule/testing/documentation parts for architecture and design milestone.

What worked: Using template on figma instead of starting for stratch for design. Using requirements and group members ideas to determine what we need in the ui to deliver the functionality we want.

What I learned: How to use figma. Learned what we are using for recipe data + how we are planning on setting up architecture and design. 

Where I had trouble: Writing out schedule because it is difficult to estimate how long tasks will take and to determine what tasks will need to be completed to the specificity that was being asked for in the instructions.

Where I am blocked: Need to learn some expressJS so I can help with frontend

#### Plans for next week:
- work on incorporating ExpressJS calls into frontend functionality
- Work on developing README doc

### Aakanksh Yadav
#### Last Week's Goals:
- Finalize the data format to use to have our front and back end communicate (with the people that will be working on the back end)
- Look into ReactJS and any other frontend options so that I can decide on which to use and learn any skills I may need for this project
- Help backend developers with any work they may need to do for setting up the MongoDB database, etc.
