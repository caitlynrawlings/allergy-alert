# Status Report: October 18
## Team Report
#### Progress and Issues:
What we did: Worked through what good use cases should look like; finished use cases and went over how to structure the rest of the requirements for the requirements milestone; discussed project scope (which features may be more like stretch features and how to come up with more achievable goals); found out how we are going to develop our project (IE what tools we are going to use)

What worked: Discussing with the client/manager (TA) to clarify how to structure project requirements; this also helped spark some conversations between team members about where our skills may lie and how we may want to split the work; team communication through discord to discuss deadlines and when we may want to schedule our work

What we learned: Learned about groupmates previous experience and comfortability. Clarified elements of requirements milestones, such as use cases and tools.

Where we had trouble: Narrowing down what architecture to use; figuring out what use cases our application had; which technologies or frameworks we may eventually decide to use and how this may affect our architecture and design decisions early on; figuring out what the original creators of the application intended since none of the creators are in our group; coming up with how we were going to get the front and back end of the application to communicate with each other

Where we are blocked: Nothing

#### Plans for next week:
- Find websites or datasets that we could incorporate into our database
- Construct the database
- Discuss and determine what format we will store our data in
- Start scraping those websites or reading those datasets
- Decide on what front end technologies/frameworks we will use
- Complete architecture and design milestone

The next deadline to work toward will be: Scrape recipe website(s) or datasets for ingredient data and construct database by October 29

## Individual Contributions
### Riley Bork
#### Progress and Issues:
What I did: I contributed to the requirements milestone with examples for use cases as well as features our project could implement, and I created the GitHub repository for our project. I also did some research on Django, a Python-based web framework, as it could be something we could use to incorporate our front-end with the back-end. 

What worked: Communication with my group as well as Melanie gave me more clarity regarding our goals for the project as well as the tasks we need to do in order to have a successful product.

What I learned: I learned the basics of Django and how we might be able to use it in our project. I also realized that we can’t really combine Django and MongoDB since the former only supports SQL databases and the latter is NoSQL. 

Where I had trouble: I’ve had trouble getting a full understanding of full stack development, particularly when it comes to retrieving back-end code from the front-end. I’ve only ever done either front-end or back-end projects and never really a combination of both, so learning how to approach this project has taken up quite a bit of time for me.

Where I was blocked: Nothing

#### Plans for next week:
- Learn more about MongoDB and how we might want to implement it
- Make a very tiny full stack project so that I can get a better understanding of combining the front-end with the back-end
### Phillip Phan
#### Progress and Issues:
What I did: I worked on this week was only contributing some ideas during the discussions

What worked: Discussion of how we are going to develop the project

What I learned: The experience of all other group members

Where I had trouble: Attending meetings because of some appointments

Where I was blocked: Nothing

#### Plans for next week:
- I plan to learn more about MongoDB
- Look at the datasets and plan a structure for the database

### Caitlyn Rawlings
#### Progress and Issues:
What I did: Contributed to the project requirements document. Discussed and decided on my role with my group.

What worked: Communicating with my group about what roles we needed and what we were all comfortable doing. Discussing with TA to understand project needs.

What I learned: Learned about the benefits of thinking about and developing use cases. 

Where I had trouble: Thinking about the architecture and design of the project because I haven’t really done a project like this before.

Where I am blocked: I think once we decide on the format of out data then it will be easier to get started, but right now I am blocked by that.

#### Plans for next week:
- Make and share doc for architecture and design milestone
- Figure out what we are doing for frontend and review some react/JS

### Jack Rosenbloom
#### Progress and Issues:
What I did: Listened to group discussion and provided input to further the project.

What worked: I sat and I listened.

What I learned: That I need to learn some css and maybe js.

Where I had trouble: Didn’t have trouble. Listening isn’t hard.

Where I am blocked: Ear canals seem to work so I believe I’m good.

#### Plans for next week:
- Learn css

### Aakanksh Yadav
#### Progress and Issues:
What I did: logistical communication about my skills and what I am comfortable doing/learning; helped finish and finalize all of the use cases and brainstorm ideas for both core/stretch features and external requirements; started thinking about what technologies/frameworks we may want to use for the frontend; brainstormed ideas about what next steps we should take (like coming up with a reasonable data format for the front and back end to be able to communicate to each other through

What worked: talking with each of the team members both in person and virtually whenever I had questions or concerns; Discord was a good communication channel for this; looking through some of my past projects for inspiration on what technologies to use or what I could contribute most to this project

What I learned: the experience of the other team members and what they are most comfortable doing; I learned a bit about the options of technologies that we began to consider for our backend (MongoDB, etc.); about the whole project and what may be a reasonable scope to aim for in the first place (since I was not in the original group that pitched this project)

Where I had trouble: it was hard to understand what a reasonable scope and set of requirements would be for this project since none of our group members were from the original group that pitched it; it has been difficult to think about how something like a ReactJS frontend could communicate with an entirely Python backend

Where I am blocked: everything is fine for now

#### Plans for next week:
- Finalize the data format to use to have our front and back end communicate (with the people that will be working on the back end)
- Look into ReactJS and any other frontend options so that I can decide on which to use and learn any skills I may need for this project
- Help backend developers with any work they may need to do for setting up the MongoDB database, etc.
