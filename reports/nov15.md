#### Last Week's Goals:
- Implement the ability to delete allergy

#### Progress and Issues:
What I did: Worked on allergy list code and added frontend tests. Brainstormed with team about UI.

Where I had trouble: I had trouble with the testing because I was pretty unfamilar with jest.

Where I was blocked: I got blocked on looking into cookie caching becasue of time so I prioritized adding tests.
