# Status Report: November 8
## Team Report
#### Last Week's Goals:
- Beta Release
- Make user search feature interface with database
- Decide on server host
- Complete basic frontend formatting
- Implement adding/editing allergies

#### Progress and Issues:
What we did: We hooked up the frontend recipe search to the database of recipes. We implemented some
search logic to prioritize exact matches for the recipe search. Implemented allergy adding and an
alert for when a allergen is found in the recipes searched for. Discussed different ways we could 
display the search results for recipes and brainstormed UI plans/goals.

What worked: Communication in the team worked. The seperation of the roles within the groups has
been working, although it has been flexible, especially as we were focussing on connecting the 
frontend and backend.

What we learned: We learned about implementing MERN stack and the interconnections of the levels.
We have also been learning from what we have been able to accomplish so far and flushed out a clearer 
idea of what functionality and UI is within the scope of our project.

Where we had trouble: We have had trouble with the timeline for all the milestones. The pace is very 
fast to keep up with all the details, especially as we have changed our design many times, which
causes cascades of changes.

Where we are blocked: Currently we are blocked on writing tests. We have been focussing on the main
deliverable of the functionality of the website, so we have fallen behind on writing comprehensive 
test suites.

#### Plans for next week:
- Implement editing allergies/removing allergies
- Checkpoint Milestone
- Implement storing allergies for each user (caching)
- Implement Allergy Alert notification logic
- Make revisions to UI design
- Finalize database/backend tests


The next deadline to work toward will be: Implement allergy editing/possibly caching for each user

## Individual Contributions

### Caitlyn Rawlings
#### Last Week's Goals:
- Work on tests for api
- Work on incoorperating frontend user interaction with the api calls

#### Progress and Issues:
What I did: I worked on tests for server side. I adjusted CI after our dir layout changed. I added code to frontend 
for when allergen appears in recipe and for when there is no result for the recipe they search for.

What worked: Communication with team. Talking about how the components should be interacting and what we want to 
have done by the beta release.

What I learned: I learned and refreshed on React and javascript stuff. I learned about the mocha and jest testing
frameworks. I learned about the workflow file and how to perform certain jobs when the file runs.

Where I had trouble: I have had trouble because there has been so much information to learn with the interactions
between the different levels of our stack and how to access the data from the database, especially as we have been
changing the format our data is stored in.

Where I was blocked: I got blocked on writing tests. I've been having a hard time with this because of having to 
learn the testing frameworks, as well as understanding how to interact with the code for the testing.

#### Plans for next week:
- Implement the ability to delete allergy
- Try to implement some sort of caching of previous allergens (perhaps by looking at the cookie)

### Jack Rosenbloom
#### Last Week’s Goals:
I plan to do some polishing work and also make more designs and maybe font reworks for the logo. I was told that’s probably the best thing I can do as the UI guy since the other’s are focused on implementing the basics together to support a command line beta.

### Aakanksh Yadav
#### Last Week’s Goals:
- Talk through our CI/CD system with my group so I am fully up to speed with it
- Help implement the search feature for our beta release (backend + search only)
- Fully adapt/finish setting up our directory to be hosted on Render (important)
- Talk to the team member in charge of UI design to coordinate how he could start on UI design for my frontend (and how we could effectively communicate to maximize how concurrent that process is)
- Start implementing frontend as soon as possible (when server hosting is done)
