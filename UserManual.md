## How to Use the Software
Simply type allergies into the allergies bar, press enter to submit. To delete
an allergy click the "X" next to the allergy under the allergy list section. 
Type the recipe you want to search for into the recipe serach bar and hit enter
to submit. If recipies from our database match the search then those recipes
will appear, along with the ingredients in the recipe and the percent of the 
recipes for that item in our database that use that ingredient.

## How to Report a Bug
Submit a bug using the "Issues" section on our project's Github.

## Known Bugs
Currently there are a few issues with our website:

1. Since we are using string-matching, plural words may not be found as ingredients to the search recipe.
2. Users are able to add duplicate allergies.
3. If certain ingredients have allergies, the website will not display those allergies since they are deeper down
than our priorities for the project thus far.
