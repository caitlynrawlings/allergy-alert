## High Level Description of Features and Functionality
Allergy Alert allows users to search for a food item to see how common certain ingredients are in recipes for that item to determine the likelihood that certain ingredients are in a food item. The app will display information for recipes that match the users search and the percentage of those recipes that contain different ingredients. Users can also input there allergies to the website and on search of a food item, the website will display an alert if one of their allergens is contained in recipes for that food item.

## Known Bugs
Currently there are a few issues with our website:

1. Since we are using string-matching, plural words may not be found as ingredients to the search recipe.
2. Users are able to add duplicate allergies.
3. If certain ingredients have allergies, the website will not display those allergies since they are deeper down
than our priorities for the project thus far.
